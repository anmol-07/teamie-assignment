In the project I used the App.vue vue's default main component on it I created a HomePage Component so as to make all the components there and all the functionality there.
Also here I broke the screen in 3 parts: 
a) FilterComponent - For date filter for from & to date.
b) SortComponent - For showing sort options.
c) UserDetailsComponent - For a particular user
